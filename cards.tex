\section{Introduction}

I am a statistics teacher and use pdflatex with Beamer to create
slides for my lessons.  Playing cards are commonly used to explain
probability, and feature in some of my slides.  A fine library of
playing cards is available in pstricks.  However, Beamer, pdflatex and
pstricks do not interact well.  I also occasionally find other times
when packages I am using in pdflatex do not allow me to use pstricks.
I wrote this package so that I could use playing cards without having
to fight with pstricks.
